# DataMiningProject
2nd year data mining project on classification and feature selection

1st. Applying a decision tree to the data to classify objects as Malignent or Benign. 
2nd. Applying an SVM after tuning its parameters to find the optimal kernel and parameters. 
3rd. Using recursive feature elimination together with the SVM model to remove features while keeping the correct classification percentage as high as possible.
